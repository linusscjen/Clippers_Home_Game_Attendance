# Clippers Home Game Attendance
This was part of the first round for the Business Analyst Intern for the Los Angeles Clippers. As a result, the data they provided will not be availabe for use here, but the write-up and all model creations will be included.

Because this was part of an application process, applicants had under four days to answer some questions and create a presentation to predict the number fans that would attend each game. Due to outside obligations, I was unable to improve my model, and thus only captured ~15-20% of the variation in attendance for home games. If time permits (this will be updated when changes are made), I would love to return to this and update the model to at least capture 50% or more of the variation.

The application was broken into two deliverables: a word writeup to answer various questions, and a powerpoint to explain our model. Refer to each folder to find the specific part you're looking for. For those who don't want to follow my code/process, I highly recommend you check the PDF's ([Deliverables Part 1](./Deliverables Part 1 Code.Rmd) and [Deliverables, Part 2.pptx](./Deliverables, Part 2.pptx)) to read up writeups. Otherwise, you can follow along ( HERE ) or ( HERE ) to see the code itself.
