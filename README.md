# Clippers Home Game Attendance

This was part of the first round for the Business Analyst Intern for the Los Angeles Clippers. As a result, the data they provided will not be availabe for use here, but the write-up and all model creations will be included.

Because this was part of an application process, applicants had under four days to answer some questions and create a presentation to predict the number fans that would attend each game. Due to outside obligations, I was unable to improve my model, and thus only captured ~15-20% of the variation in attendance for home games. If time permits (this will be updated when changes are made), I would love to return to this and update the model to at least capture 50% or more of the variation.
